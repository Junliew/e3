  Feedback provided:
  1) <load-link> 
    -Changed the load time for loadPageAfterDelay to 5000, the original was too long and it would confuse the website visitors
    -Changed the cursor to pointer so it matches with the cursors with the rest of the website, also it is more responsive
    -Added colour on hover so people will know it is clickable
    -Made it increase in size and change colour to create a more fun and interactive experience, also emphasizes its importance

  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)
    -created a new load throbber style to a spinner
    -I also created an animation for it which changes colours during the loading so it indicates that the page is loading
    -This also makes the loading experience more colourful, fun and interactive

  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)*done
    -added transition timing function ease-in-out for a smoother experience
    -changed the colour on hover to make it more responsive so viewers know it is clickable and might lead to somewhere

  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html) done
    -changed the colour on hover to make it more responsive so viewers know it is clickable and might lead to somewhere
    - Made it look more like a button and styling its padding and border-radius

  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition
     - I Changed the transition to 2s so there is a slighty longer respond time for a smoother transition
     - I also added transition-timing-function: ease-in for a smoother experience

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

        The function loadPageAfterDelay() is declared in the file fakeLoad.js - it takes a number value that sets the 
        amount of time it takes in ms and a url to redirect to.

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
